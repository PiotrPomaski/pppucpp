Programming Principles and Practice Using C++ (PPPUC++)
=======================================================

This repository contains the drills, exercises, and other assignments, for the classic book 'Programming Principles and Practice Using C++' (PPPUC++), written by the creator of C++ himself, Dr. Bjarne Stroustrup. Please note there are no assignments in chapter 1. In addition, the exercises for chapter 2 (p.55) are not included because they are highly subjective. Other exercises throughout the book may not be included if, for example, they ask the reader to write something on a piece of paper, examine the compiler errors of flawed code, etcetera. Programming techniques are applied to the exercises as they are introduced in the book. Functions, for example, are not introduced until chapter 4.

### Background

When I first started programming, I hopped around various languages, frameworks, tutorials, and code camps, never building a solid foundation for myself. Looking back, my journey should have started right here with PPPUC++. This book is an invaluable resource for anyone interested in the C++ language. After learning C++, everything else makes sense.

This book can serve as both a guide for beginners, or a refresher for advanced programmers. Dr. Stroustrup wrote this book with great care, and it is quite enjoyable to read. His humorous personality livens up what could have easily been a dry technical document. It is truly an honor to have Dr. Stroustrup still spearheading the C++ language today.

At times you may feel that some of these exercises are overkill or redundant. You will probably even curse at this book. Dr. Stroustrup likes to throw curve ball challenges that appear simple at first glance, but end up being complex. At the end of the day, however, these challenges force you to dig deeper, ask questions, think critically, and engage the C++ community. As the saying goes, *if you're not failing you're not learning*.
