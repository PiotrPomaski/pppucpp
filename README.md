This repository contains the drills and exercises for the classic book 'Programming Principles and Practice Using C++' (PPPUC++). Please note there are no assignments in chapter 1.

When I first started programming I hopped around various languages, tutorials, and code camps, and never really built a solid foundation for myself. Looking back, I should have started right here with PPPUC++. This book has been an invaluable resource and this is my way of giving back. I recommend this book to all C++ developers regardless of your skill level.
