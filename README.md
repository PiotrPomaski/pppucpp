Programming Principles and Practice Using C++
=============================================

This repository contains the drills, exercises, and other assignments, for the classic book 'Programming Principles and Practice Using C++' (PPPUC++), written by the creator of C++ himself, Dr. Bjarne Stroustrup. Please note there are no assignments in chapter 1. In addition, due to their subjective nature, the exercises for chapter 2 (p.55) are not included.

When I first started programming, I hopped around various languages, tutorials, and code camps, never really building a solid foundation. Looking back, my journey should have started right here with PPPUC++. This book is an invaluable resource for anyone interested in C++. It serves as both a guide for beginners, and a refresher for advanced programmers. Dr. Stroustrup wrote this book with great care and it is quite enjoyable to read. His humorous personality livens up what could have easily been a dry technical book. You can find PPPUC++ at Dr. Stroustrup's personal website http://stroustrup.com/programming.html. Search around the site and you will also find many great resources for C++ programming, including slides that help with these exercises. It is an honor to have Dr. Stroustrup still spearheading the C++ language today.
