Programming Principles and Practice Using C++ (PPPUC++)
=======================================================

This repository contains the drills, exercises, and other assignments, for the classic book 'Programming Principles and Practice Using C++' (PPPUC++), written by the creator of C++ himself, Dr. Bjarne Stroustrup. Please note there are no assignments in chapter 1. In addition, the exercises for chapter 2 (p.55) are not included because they are highly subjective. Other exercises throughout the book may not be included if, for example, they ask the reader to write something on a piece of paper, examine compiler errors, flawed code, etcetera. Dr. Stroustrup encourages self-initiative when completing the exercises (p.5). The student is encouraged to explore, be creative, and use their imaginations. The same thought process is also applied to the drills of this book.

### Background

The programming journey usually starts with hopping around between various languages, frameworks, tutorials, and code camps, following every bandwagon that passes by. This unfortunate practice can do more harm than good in terms of a programmer's foundation. In retrospect, the journey should begin right here with PPPUC++. This book is an invaluable resource for anyone interested in the C++ language, or programming in general. After learning C++, everything else makes sense.

This book can serve as both a guide for beginners, or a refresher for advanced programmers. Dr. Stroustrup has an amazing ability to teach, which is an extremely rare trait in technology. He wrote this book with great care, and it is quite enjoyable to read. His humorous personality livens up what could have easily been a dry technical book. It is truly an honor to have Dr. Stroustrup still spearheading the C++ language today. In some ways, this archive is a "thank you" to Dr. Stroustrup for all of his work, which has been instrumental in the advancement of technology, and has influenced the lives of many developers throughout the world.

At times you may feel that some of the exercises are overkill or redundant. You will probably even curse at this book. Dr. Stroustrup is known for throwing curve ball challenges at his students, which, appear simple at first glance, and end up being quite challenging. At the end of the day, however, these challenges force you to dig deeper, ask questions, think critically, and engage the C++ community. As the saying goes, *if you're not failing you're not learning*.
