Programming Principles and Practice Using C++
=============================================

This repository contains the drills and exercises for the classic book 'Programming Principles and Practice Using C++' (PPPUC++), written by the creator of C++ himself, Dr. Bjarne Stroustrup. Please note there are no assignments in chapter 1.

When I first started programming, I hopped around various languages, tutorials, and code camps, never really building a solid foundation. Looking back, I should have started right here with PPPUC++. This book has been an invaluable resource. It is recommended to all C++ programmers of all skill levels. It can serve as a guide for beginners, or a refresher for advanced programmers. We are truly blessed to have Dr. Stroustrup in our midst today, still spearheading the C++ language.
