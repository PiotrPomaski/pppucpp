Programming Principles and Practice Using C++
=============================================

This repository contains the drills, exercises, and other assignments, for the classic book 'Programming Principles and Practice Using C++' (PPPUC++), written by the creator of C++ himself, Dr. Bjarne Stroustrup. Please note there are no assignments in chapter 1 so you will not find a directory for it.

When I first started programming, I hopped around various languages, tutorials, and code camps, never really building a solid foundation. Looking back, I should have started right here with PPPUC++. This book is an invaluable resource, and is recommended to anyone interested in C++. It serves as a guide for beginners, and a refresher for advanced programmers. Dr. Stroustrup wrote this book with great care and it is quite enjoyable to read. You can find this book on his personal website at http://stroustrup.com/programming.html. It is an honor to have Dr. Stroustrup still spearheading the C++ language today.
