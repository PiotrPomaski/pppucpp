## Answers

1. The purpose of the "Hello, World!" program is to try your programming environment, and to get a first feel of controlling a computer.
2. The four parts of a function are 1) return type, 2) name, 3) parameter list, and 4) function body.
3. The function _main_ must appear in every C++ program.
4. Since function _main_ is of type **int**, the line **return 0;** tells us whehter or not the program has finished successfully.
5. The purpose of the compiler is to translate human-readable code, i.e. source code or program text,  into something that the machine can read, i.e. executables, object code, or machine code.
6. The include directive tells the computer to include external source code files, such as a header file or a library.
7. In C++, the **.h** suffix signifies that it is a source code file, and is commonly referred to as a header file.
8. The linker glues together all of the required parts of a program into an executable, including source code and object code.
9. The difference between a source code file and object file is that the former is human-readable, and the latter is machine-readable.
10. An IDE is an _interacive development environment_, which is a typically a gui based editor that facilitates coding and compilation with various features such as color coding, button-click compilation, debugging, etc.
11. In a famous study conducted on music students in Berlin, it was found that mastering something, in this case the violin, requires approximately 10,000 hours of practice. Whether you agree with this study or not, its general premise cannot be denied in that mastering something takes time and lots of practice. Therefore if you want to master computer programming you have to put the work in and practice.
