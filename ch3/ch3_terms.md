4. **conversion** - Moving a value of one object type into another object type
5. **declaration** - A statement that gives a name to an object
6. **decrement** - To decrease by the amount of a specified integer
7. **definition** - A declaration that sets aside memory for an object
8. **increment** - To increase by the amount of a specified integer

15. **type** - A method or thing that defines a set of possible values and a set of operations for an object
16. **type safety** - Best practices for avoiding operations that are not considered type-safe, such as narrowing or uninitialized variables
17. **value** - An allocated set of bits in memory interpreted according to an object type
18. **variable** - A named object
