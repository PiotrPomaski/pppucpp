========================

**abstraction** -  the technique of hiding details that are not needed, such as a header file.
**computation** - generating ouptuts with inputs.
**conditional statement** - an statement that executes code on the condition that some criteria is met, such as a **while**-statement.
**declaration** - a type of expression statement that involves the initialization and     naming of an object.
**definition** - a type of declaration that includes intructions to complete a program, and allocate memory accordingly.
**divide and conquer** - dividing large programs into small ones according to the distinctions of different tasks.
**else** - a form of programming selection that provides an alternative if the first one fails.
**expression** - a computation that generates a value from a set of operands.
**for**-statement - a form of programming iteration that enables programs to iterate over data structures through the use of control variables, commonly implemented for collections of data.
range-**for**-statement - a form of iteration used to traversing a sequence of elements in a **vector**.
**function** - a named sequence of statements.
**if**-statement - a form of programming selection that chooses between two alternatives.
**increment** - to increase by a specified amount.
**input** - information coming into a computer.
**iteration** - the act of repitition.
**loop** - to repeat a statement.
**lvalue** - as described in this chapter, the value on the left side of an assignment operator.
**member function** - a function that is a member of a class.
**output** - information going out of a computer.
**push_back()** - a member function of the **vector** class that adds elements to the end of a **vector**.
**repetition** - the act of repeating something.
**rvalue** - as described in this chapter, the value on the right side of an assignment operator.
**selection** - a programming technique that invovles choosing between alternatives, and executing some code based on those selections, typically in the form of an **if**, **while**, or **switch** statement.
**size()** - a member function of the **vector** class that determines the size of a **vector**.
**sort()** - a member function of the **vector** class that organizes the elements of a **vector** alphanumerically.
**statement** - a computational expression with a semi-colon.
**switch**-statement - a form of selective programming that typically involves choosing between more than two alternatives.
**vector** - a data structure that contains a sequence of elements that are accessible by an index, enabling programs to store or create collections of data.
**while**-statement - a form of iteration that allows the repitition of code through the use of some control variable that depends on a conditional expression.
