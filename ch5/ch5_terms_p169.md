=======================

**argument error** - An error caused by bad arguments given by the caller of a function, i.e. a type mismatch, too few or too many arguments, or even a simple typo.

**assertion** - A statement that states an invariant.

**catch** - A statement used with execptions for the purpose of catching errors thrown by a try-block.

**compile-time error** - An error that is detected exclusively by the compiler.

**container** - An object that holds collections of data, such as a vector.

**debugging** - The process of detecting and removing errors in a program.

**error** - an instance of a wide ranging category of mistakes or flaws in a program, such as bad input, typos, incorrect logic, poor planning, and many more.

**exception** - an error that is thrown by a function and handled according  to the programmer's instructions.

**invariant** - a condition that should always hold.

**link-time error** - an error that is detected exclusively by the linker, typically caused by a missing library or header file.

**logic error** - an instance of a broad category of errors that cause programs to generate erroneous output, such as a poorly thought-out **if**-statement.

**post-condition** - a program check that is placed upon the return value of a function.

**pre-condition** - a program check that is placed upon an input, before the return value.

**range error** - an instance of an error that occurs with containers, relating to a discrepency between some call, and the number of elements in the container.

**requirement** - a condition placed upon the argument a function.

**run-time error** - an error that are detected within a running program, typically related to checks that are commonly executed by system hardware or software, external libraries, or programmer code.

**syntax errors** - grammatical errors that occurr when the syntax of programmer code does not conform to the rules of C++ grammar, such as a missing parenthesis, or a block that is not terminated.

**testing** - a highly systematic process of finding errors in a program that typically involves feeding a program well-planned, and highly selective inputs designed to break a program.

**throw** - a statement used with the **exception** mechanism that is designed to break a program out of a function when an error occurrs, without returning a value.

**type error** - an error that is caused by a mismatch between the types that are declared for objects, and the values that are assigned to them.
